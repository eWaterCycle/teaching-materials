    "Q = k S ^\\alpha\n",

    "\n",
    "Next to this, we also assmume a linear reservoir, so $\\alpha$ is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these assumptions, the system can be solved analytically. This makes it possible to calculate the storage and discharge at any time by knowing the initial condition and the ```k``` value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Derive the analytical solution of the reservoir, as mentioned without the external drivers and as a **linear** reservoir. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for hydrological systems it is not realistic to neglect the external drivers. If we take into account these drivers, the equation cannot be solved analytically, but has to be solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a numerical solution is the explicit forward Euler method. This method calculates the state of a system at each time step considering the state of the system at the previous time step and rate of changes:\n",

    "The forward Euler method yields:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{S(t + \\Delta t) - S(t)}{\\Delta t} = -kS^\\alpha\n",

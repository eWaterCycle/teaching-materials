# Hydrological modelling
The exercises below on hydrological modelling are developed for the course "River Basin Hydrology and Water Management" tought at Delft University of Technology in the Environmental Engineering Master of Science (MSc) program. The course code at Delft is ENVM1502. When working on these exercises, it is assumed that the student is familiar with the following concepts:

- hydrology
  - water balance
  - (river) catchment
  - precipitation
  - evaporation (actual evaporation and potential evaporation)
  - (river) discharge, also known as streamflow.
- mathematics
  - first order differential equations
  - analytical and numerically solving differential equations
- programming
  - python
    - numpy
    - pandas

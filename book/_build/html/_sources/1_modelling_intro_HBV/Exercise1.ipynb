    "## 1. Linear Reservoir without External Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, we will consider the reservoir without the external drivers `P` and `E`, and we assume that `Q` is equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q = k S^\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to this, we also assume a linear reservoir, so $\\alpha$ is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these assumptions, the system can be solved analytically. This makes it possible to calculate the storage and discharge at any time by knowing the initial condition and the `k` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Derive the analytical solution of the reservoir, as mentioned, without the external drivers and as a **linear** reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for hydrological systems, it is not realistic to neglect the external drivers. If we take these drivers into account, the equation cannot be solved analytically but must be solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example of a numerical solution is the explicit forward Euler method. This method calculates the state of a system at each time step considering the state of the system at the previous time step and the rate of changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S(t + \\Delta t) = F(S(t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the linear reservoir problem without the external drivers, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -k S(t)^\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward Euler method yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{S(t + \\Delta t) - S(t)}{\\Delta t} = -kS(t)^\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the numerical solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S(t + \\Delta t) = S(t) - k \\Delta t S(t)^\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, if $S(t)$ is known, $S(t + \\Delta t)$ can be calculated in one iteration. The big assumption in the forward Euler model is that $S(t)$ is relatively constant during the timestep. This may not always be true. If $S(t)$ changes rapidly, smaller timesteps need to be used to avoid significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other, more sophisticated methods for numerically solving differential equations exist, such as Runge-Kutta. Refer to the material from the MUDE course for more information on those. In hydrology, it is always important to evaluate whether the error introduced by your numerical scheme is significant compared to the error introduced by the model's inherent imperfections.\n"

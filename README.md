# Welcome to ENVM1502

This repository is used for the course ENVM1502 at the Technical University of Delft.
Making use of [eWaterCycle](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) students will learn how to implement their own HBV models.

In the first chapter we will cover how to make a HBV model.
In chapter two we will take you through your own HBV implementation and how to calibrate and use generate CMIP data for HBV.
Chapter three explains to concept of flextopo.

## Chapter 1: modelling introduction HBV

### Modelling exercise 1: Linear Reservoir
This is where we get familiar with hydrological bucket modelling.

### Models Exercise 2: Lumped Conceptual Model
Here you make your first HBV model implementation.

## Chapter 2: modelling eWaterCycle

### Exercise 1. Test your own HBV model on eWaterCycle
Having learnt how to make a working HBV model you will now learn to make it BMI compatible and test your own implementation.

### Exercise 2. Generate forcing for any region from ERA5 for HBV model
Using your own shape file you can load in ERA5 data for a HBV model.

### Exercise 3: Run HBV model with ERA5 forcing and GRDC observation
Run your own HBV region model and compare it to observations.

### Exercise 4: Calibrate HBV model with ERA5 forcing and GRDC observation
Calibrate your own HBV region model and compare it to observations.

### Exercise 5: Generate forcing for any region from CMIP6 for HBV model
We will learn to generate CMIP6 forcing for your research question.

## Chapter 3: modelling flextopo
Here we will look into modelling/calibrating different parts of your region (hillslopes, plateaus, wetlands and basins).

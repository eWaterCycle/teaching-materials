# Welcome to ENVM1502

This repository is used for the course ENVM1502 at the Technical University of Delft.
Making use of [eWaterCycle](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) students will learn how to implement their own HBV models.

In the first chapter we will cover how to make a HBV model.
In chapter two we will take you through your own HBV implementation and how to calibrate and use generate CMIP data for HBV.
Chapter three explains to concept of flextopo.
